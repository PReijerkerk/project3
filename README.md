This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# [TROPHY CASE](https://tc-trophy-case.herokuapp.com/) - brought to you by heroku

The all encombassing collections app for those who are want an organized expression of their possessions!

## Motiviation:
We created this app to fill a need to archive and store our personal collections - we maintain this app to ensure others who have similar needs can have their hobbies, passtimes, or otherwise - stored in a 'safe' & 'clean' platform that we know will make your life's collection a more accessable extension of your interests! 

## Feature used:
- Bootstrap 4
- [Pose JS](https://popmotion.io/pose/) - animation library
- [Rellax JS](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/) - Pure JS parallax library
- [Passport JS](http://www.passportjs.org/) - user Authentication

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

We proudly thought testing would be an asset for future development so we wanted to incorperate some basic [Error Boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) testing by using these useful packages:
 - [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
 - [enzyme-to-JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enzyme-to-json) - a pretty way to see your tests running in your terminal
 - [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)
 
 * And we hope to develope future in our endevours to have more error testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in the future!

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
